## Overview

So I decided to use Frontend Mentor to learn and practice front-end dev and this is my first challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Non-Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query


### What I learned

I learned a lot in the development of this little project I learned how to use flexbox and media query.

### Continued development

My aim for future projects is to learn and apply grid and animations.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - When I forget something about documentation about any language I always look for w3schools
- [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - When I want to learn a new concept of css css-tricks is the best page for that because they always
have a lot of examples.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
